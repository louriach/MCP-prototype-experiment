## Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Modern CSS with custom properties, Flexbox, and media queries
- **Inter Font** - From Google Fonts (400, 600, 700 weights)

## Browser Support

Modern browsers supporting:
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS3 features

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` or `page2.html` in a modern web browser to view the pages.

## Design System

The design follows a consistent system with:
